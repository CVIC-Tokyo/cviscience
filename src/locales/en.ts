  CVIC_DOCK: {
    TITLE: "New Cardiovascular and Brain Checkups Offered by CVIC",
    CONTENT:
      "Since its opening in 2009, the CVIC Cardiovascular Imaging Clinic Iidabashi has conducted over 73,000 MRI and CT examinations of patients' hearts, making it Japan's first and rare global specialized heart imaging center. The number of heart MRI examinations accounts for about 10% of the total in Japan and ranks among the top five in the world. Through heart imaging examinations at CVIC, we have discovered severe heart diseases that were previously unnoticed and detected early-stage heart diseases, facilitating appropriate treatment and preventive medicine. CVIC's efforts have garnered attention domestically and internationally, and are frequently covered by the domestic media. Based on this wealth of experience in heart imaging diagnostics, we have come to realize the need for a new framework for cardiovascular imaging examinations to further demonstrate their usefulness."
  },
  NEW_CHECKUP_MENU: {
    TITLE: "Introduction of New Cardiovascular and Brain Checkup Menu",
    CONTENT:
      "The newly introduced menu consists of two components: 'Blood Biomarker Testing' combining high-sensitivity blood tests and 'Personalized Cardiovascular Testing' tailored to individual heart disease risks and physical conditions. 'Blood Biomarker Testing' includes comprehensive result explanations and specific advice online or via phone, as well as follow-ups three months later. Advances in high-sensitivity blood testing allow for further subdivision of normal values rather than simply categorizing as normal or abnormal, enabling predictions of future risks. Merely undergoing examinations is not meaningful; it is only when the examination results are utilized in daily lifestyle habits and future disease prevention that their usefulness can be demonstrated. Through 'Blood Biomarker Testing,' we aim to set specific target values and consider individual measures to contribute to maintaining cardiovascular health for everyone."

      "With the aim of realizing the desire to deliver the latest and best cardiovascular imaging diagnosis to as many patients as possible, we have decided to establish the 'Heart Imaging Clinic Iidabashi,' a specialized cardiovascular imaging diagnosis center in Iidabashi, Tokyo.",
    TERASHIMA_MESSAGE_P2:
      "In recent years, the technology for imaging diagnosis of the heart has made rapid progress. Using state-of-the-art imaging diagnostic techniques such as CT and MRI, it has become possible to conduct examinations with minimal exposure to radiation and discomfort. In outpatient settings, it is possible to perform three-dimensional imaging of the heart, including the coronary arteries (blood vessels surrounding the heart), in a short period of time. Previously, heart examinations relied on electrocardiograms and X-rays, but with the use of CT and MRI, it has become possible to accurately assess the heart's movements and three-dimensional (3D) morphology with minimal physical burden.",
    TERASHIMA_MESSAGE_P3:
      "Cardiovascular imaging diagnosis holds great potential for the prevention and early detection of heart disease. I have been engaged in clinical and research activities related to cardiovascular imaging diagnosis for seven and a half years at Stanford University in the United States, and I have great expectations and confidence in its potential. Therefore, I have returned to Japan with the intention of returning my experience and research results to Japanese medicine and solving the problems of cardiovascular imaging diagnosis. As a practical endeavor, I have established Japan's first and rare specialized cardiovascular imaging center. I believe that Japan's excellent medical technology can confidently expand overseas. While seeking the cooperation of a wide range of medical professionals, I am determined to work towards the goal of providing the latest and best cardiovascular imaging diagnosis to as many patients as possible, expanding this goal to the world.",

  HEART_MRI_SCAN: {
    TITLE: "Heart MRI Scan",
    DESCRIPTION: [
      "MRI, in simple terms, is a method of creating images of the state of hydrogen nuclei abundant in water and fat in the body using magnets and radio waves. In MRI, a cylindrical device is required to generate a uniform magnetic field, equipped with magnets thousands of times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field (Figure A). It requires highly skilled techniques to create this uniform magnetic field, which is why MRI devices are expensive. Additionally, to receive signals of radio waves generated from the body, receiver coils tailored to each part of the body are necessary. For the heart, dedicated receiver coils are used (B). The body is placed inside the cylindrical magnet with a uniform magnetic field, radio waves are irradiated for a short period, and images are created by receiving radio waves emitted from the body when the radio waves are stopped (C). Looking more closely, it visualizes the behavior of hydrogen nuclei spins (rotation) in the body (D).",
      "",
      "First, hydrogen nuclei are aligned in a certain direction in a strong magnetic field. Next, weak radio waves in the frequency band of radio are irradiated, allowing hydrogen nuclei contained in a cross-section of the body to absorb the energy of the radio waves. When the radio wave irradiation is stopped, the absorbed energy is released back, and the signal of the radio waves obtained at that time is visualized by a computer. Note that each time radio waves are irradiated in MRI, the machine generates vibration sounds, which can be quite loud. This is the main cause of the loud noises heard during MRI scans. A major advantage of MRI scans is that they do not use radiation, so there is no concern about 'exposure.'",
      "",
      "Furthermore, in heart MRI scans, it is possible to depict coronary arteries without radiation exposure or the use of contrast agents. Simultaneously, evaluation of cardiac pump function (cardiac function) is possible, and the evaluation of cardiac function by heart MRI is considered to be the most reliable and is adopted in various clinical studies on cardiac function. Moreover, contrast-enhanced heart MRI scans using contrast agents have a high potential to obtain all information separately obtained from conventional cardiac image diagnostics such as echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy, and coronary angiography in about one hour. Therefore, it is called a 'one-stop shop' overseas.",
